//! shaders.rs: the four required shaders (handout, Section 5), their
//! parameter structs (include/shaders.h, same layout), and the noise
//! function BUMPY is built on.
//!
//! CONSTANT, STANDARD, CHECKERBOARD, perlinNoise and BUMPY are stubs for you
//! to fill in, in that order. Every scene file binds the shaders by name
//! (RiSurface(CHECKERBOARD, &cp, sizeof cp)), and some call perlinNoise
//! directly, so keep the names, the signatures and the structs as they are.
//!
//! A shader is an ordinary function. The renderer fills in the inputs of the
//! RtShaderContext (ri.rs) at every grid vertex and calls the shader; a
//! surface shader writes Ci and Oi, a displacement shader moves P. The
//! context arrives as a raw pointer from C; `let c = &mut *c;` turns it into
//! a reference for the rest of the function.

#![allow(non_snake_case)] // the shader names are the handout's
#![allow(dead_code)] // the stubs do not read their parameter structs yet

/// light shader means STANDARD; a None dark shader means STANDARD with
/// Cs = black, so that only its highlights show.
///
/// You don't choose the sub-shaders: the scene does, in the CheckerParams it
/// binds, just as it passes any shader its parameters. The model scenes'
/// floors, for example, do

/// RiSurface copied that struct, so here c.params points at it. A shader is
/// a plain function, so run a check's sub-shader by calling it, with
/// c.params pointed at the sub-shader's own parameters during the call:
///     let p = &*(c.params as *const CheckerParams);

/// do some scene files' own shaders (Fbm in sceneutil.h), so until it works
/// those surfaces come out smooth and plain.
///
/// Follow his algorithm exactly: his permutation of 0..255, his fade curve
/// 6t^5 - 15t^4 + 10t^3 and his gradient function. Any other noise looks
/// just as good, but your bumps will not match reference_renders/. The
/// result is smooth and signed, about [-1, 1], and exactly 0 at every
/// integer point. Points may be negative or far from the origin, so make
/// sure the lattice index wraps into 0..255 for those too (f64 in, f64 out:
/// BUMPY's high octaves need the precision).

/// each octave counts half as much as the one below it, and dividing by the
