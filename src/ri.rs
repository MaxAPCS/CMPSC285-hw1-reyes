//! ri.rs: the HW1 RenderMan-like interface (include/Ri.h) in Rust, and the
//! renderer behind it.
//!
//! The scene files are C++ and compile against Ri.h; this file declares the
//! same types with the same memory layout (#[repr(C)]) and exports the same
//! functions with C linkage (#[no_mangle] extern "C"), so the unchanged
//! scene files link against your renderer. Keep every signature as it is.
//!
//! This is a stub. Every function the scenes call is here, does nothing
//! useful yet, and RiWorldEnd writes a black image of the right size and
//! name, so the whole kit builds and runs before you have written a line.
//! Replace the stubs with your REYES renderer, following the Suggested
//! Workflow: transformations and the camera first, then one primitive
//! (FirstPrimitive_sphere is the scene for it), then dicing, sampling, the
//! hider, the other primitives, shading, textures, displacement, opacity,
//! and depth output. The comment on each function says what the finished
//! version must do and where the handout describes it. Split the code into
//! more modules as it grows.
//!
//! The two functions at the end, write_image and write_depth, are complete:
//! they write the file RiDisplay named, in the format its extension says,
//! from a buffer you fill in. Nothing else here is.
//!
//! The shaders live in shaders.rs. Everything the scene files include is in
//! ../include/ and must not change: Ri.h, shaders.h and scenes.h are the
//! interface; obj.h, shadowmap.h, sceneutil.h, anim.h and models.h are
//! helpers for the scene files that never call back into the renderer
//! except through that interface.

#![allow(non_snake_case)] // the Ri names and the context's fields are RenderMan's
#![allow(dead_code)] // the parts of the interface the stub does not use yet
